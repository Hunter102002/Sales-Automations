## All Automations I actually created in my current role but cannot show/use the data of current employer

## Steps

The first automation is going to be a calendly Welcome/Prep email, this is going to send the prospect a thank you email and let them know what come prepared with, a reminder of when and as well some meeting info so they do not loose it to ensure they show up to the meeting

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Triggered by a new Calendly or Typeform demo request, this automation sends a confirmation email, logs the lead in the CRM, and schedules a follow-up sequence if no response is received.
	- Impact: Improved response and show-up rates through immediate engagement; maintained CRM hygiene automatically.

Closed-Won → Sales-to-CS Handoff Workflow

When a deal is marked Closed-Won in the CRM, the system:
	- Sends a Slack alert to the Customer Success team with account details
	- Sends a client onboarding email with resources and next steps
	- Creates a handoff task in Notion or ClickUp
	- Updates CRM status to “Handoff Initiated”
	- Impact: Ensured 100% of new clients receive onboarding within 24 hours; eliminated manual handoff errors.
